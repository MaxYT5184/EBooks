  <h1>💖 Just a Little Sussy – Part 1: Locker Games</h1>
  <p>It was just past noon, and the halls of Eastbridge High buzzed with Friday energy. Students slammed lockers, teachers sipped coffee like it was oxygen, and everyone was counting down the minutes until the weekend.</p>
  <p>Ava Monroe leaned against her locker, one earbud in, pretending to scroll. She wasn’t looking for drama—but when Hector Reyes came strutting around the corner with that smug half-smile and way-too-confident walk, she already knew: drama found her.</p>
  <p>As if on cue, his phone “slipped” from his hand and landed at her feet.</p>
  <p>She raised a brow. “Really? That your new pickup line?”</p>
  <p>Hector grinned. “Gravity works in mysterious ways. Sometimes it pulls me right toward what I want.”</p>
  <p>“Sounds sussy,” Ava smirked.</p>
  <p>“Strategically sussy,” Hector replied, leaning down to grab the phone but not breaking eye contact.</p>
  <p>Ava leaned forward, playing along. “What exactly are you researching with all these clumsy encounters?”</p>
  <p>“Only the most important subject,” he said smoothly. “You.”</p>
  <p>The warning bell rang, but neither of them moved.</p>
  <p>“So… you flirting with me, or are you just naturally like this?” Ava asked.</p>
  <p>“Let’s test that theory. Milkshakes after school?”</p>
  <p>She hesitated for half a second… then smirked. “Fine. But if you pull another stunt like that, I’m confiscating your phone.”</p>
  <p>“No need,” Hector said with a wink. “I’ll be too busy holding your hand.”</p>
  <p>Ava rolled her eyes, but she was smiling.</p>

  <h2>💖 Just a Little Sussy – Part 2: Ava’s Confession</h2>
  <p>Saturday night lit the arcade like a dream. Neon lights, buzzing games, and the smell of buttery popcorn made it feel like something out of a cheesy rom-com. Ava was very aware that Hector hadn’t taken his eyes off her since they arrived.</p>
  <p>They played air hockey. He let her win the first game. Destroyed her the second. Then leaned close and whispered:</p>
  <p>“Wanna break the tie? Or should I just win you next?”</p>
  <p>“You’re so sussy,” Ava laughed. “I can’t tell if you’re serious or if this is all part of the game.”</p>
  <p>“Who says it can’t be both?” Hector replied, eyes dancing.</p>
  <p>By the end of the night, they stood on her doorstep. The air was quiet. Intense. That unspoken something hung in the space between them.</p>
  <p>“This was…” Hector said, rubbing the back of his neck, “honestly? The best part of my week.”</p>
  <p>“It was kind of perfect,” Ava admitted. “But I still don’t trust you. You flirt too easy.”</p>
  <p>“Only with you,” he said, stepping closer. “You’re… different.”</p>
  <p>He leaned in. Not a full kiss—but his lips brushed her cheek, soft and warm.</p>
  <p>Ava’s heart did an entire backflip.</p>

  <h2>💄 The Next Morning – Girls’ Bathroom</h2>
  <p>“OKAY,” Ava burst into the bathroom with Lani and Jess behind her. “I am in SO much trouble.”</p>
  <p>Lani: “What happened?!”</p>
  <p>Jess: “Was it the date? Did he kiss you? Is he good at it??”</p>
  <p>Ava spun to face them: “Listen. I swear I hated him like two weeks ago. Now I want to marry him.”</p>
  <p>Both girls screamed in sync.</p>
  <p>“It’s the way he looked at me, girls,” Ava continued. “Like I was a secret he already knew and couldn’t wait to open again.”</p>
  <p>Jess gasped. “Girl, you’re GONE.”</p>
  <p>“And when he saw me at the brand club last week,” Ava whispered, clutching her chest, “he didn’t even glance at the runway. He looked right at me. Like I was the only thing shining in that room.”</p>
  <p>Lani: “Okay, that’s hot. That’s movie hot.”</p>
  <p>Ava nodded, dreamy: “I’m serious. He’s trouble. But I don’t even care anymore.”</p>

  <h2>💖 Just a Little Sussy – Part 3: Hector Finds Out</h2>
  <p>Monday rolled in like a tidal wave of teenage chaos.</p>
  <p>Ava was at her locker, casually talking to Lani, when suddenly she heard it:</p>
  <p>“So…” Hector’s voice behind her. “Heard I’ve been the hot topic in the girls’ bathroom.”</p>
  <p>She froze. Turned slowly.</p>
  <p>“Who told you that?!”</p>
  <p>“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Hector smirked. “Let’s just say... walls talk.”</p>
  <p>Her face went red. “I didn’t say anything that crazy…”</p>
  <p>“Really?” he leaned in, voice low. “Because I heard the word ‘marry’ was involved.”</p>
  <p>Ava shoved him playfully, but he caught her hand before she could pull it back.</p>
  <p>“Listen,” he said, suddenly more serious, “I’m into you. Not just for fun. I’m not gonna ghost, I’m not playing games. I meant it. You’re different.”</p>
  <p>She blinked. For once, no snappy comeback came to her.</p>
  <p>“So,” he smiled, breaking the silence. “Still wanna confiscate my phone? Or should we just call it our phone now?”</p>
  <p>Ava laughed out loud. “Suuuper sussy.”</p>
  <p>“But you love it,” he said, leaning just close enough again.</p>
  <p>“Ugh,” she rolled her eyes. “Yeah. I really, really do.”</p>

  <h2>💖 Just a Little Sussy – Part 4: Prom Night</h2>
  <p>The night was electric. The gym was transformed into a glittering dream — fairy lights, a starlit ceiling, and a sea of flowing dresses and sharp tuxedos. Prom night at Eastbridge High was the night, and Ava Monroe and Hector Reyes were about to make it unforgettable.</p>
  <p>Ava twirled in front of the mirror, adjusting her strapless navy blue gown, her heart racing. Her friends had already finished getting ready, but she couldn’t help but keep checking her phone. Where was he?</p>
  <p>Just then, her phone buzzed.</p>
  <p><strong>Hector:</strong> "I'm outside. Got a surprise for you. Better be ready."</p>
  <p>Ava grinned, slipping her phone into her clutch before running out the door. When she reached the front porch, her breath caught.</p>
  <p>Hector was standing by a sleek black car, a grin on his face, looking like he just stepped out of a movie.</p>
  <p>“Wow,” Ava said, eyes wide. “You clean up nice.”</p>
  <p>Hector flashed a sly smile, the usual cocky edge to his voice. “I told you I’d make prom night unforgettable.”</p>
  <p>He opened the car door for her, and she slid inside, her heart fluttering. The night felt like it was just beginning, and she had no idea what kind of magic Hector had planned.</p>
  <p>When they arrived at the school, the doors opened, and the sounds of laughter, music, and chatter filled the air. The moment they walked in together, the whole room seemed to pause. Ava felt a surge of confidence from Hector’s hand in hers, like they were stepping into a dream they both shared.</p>
  <p>“You look perfect,” Hector whispered as they walked toward the dance floor.</p>
  <p>Ava smiled, leaning into him. “You’re not so bad yourself.”</p>
  <p>The DJ hit play on the next song, and the upbeat pop track pulsed through the room. Hector didn’t wait for her to say a word; he pulled her onto the dance floor, holding her close as they moved together to the beat. Her heart was in her throat, and every moment felt like something straight out of a movie.</p>
  <p>As they danced, Ava couldn’t stop smiling, and Hector kept glancing at her, eyes full of admiration. He spun her around, pulling her back into his arms, the rhythm making her forget everything but him.</p>
  <p>“I can’t believe this is real,” Ava said breathlessly, looking up at him.</p>
  <p>“It is,” Hector whispered. “You’re my real life dream.”</p>
  <p>She blushed. She had no idea what he was talking about, but she knew this felt different. This wasn’t just prom. This was something special.</p>
  <p>The music shifted to a slow ballad, and the crowd around them began to pull back, leaving the two of them in the center of the dance floor. Hector didn’t hesitate. He placed his hands on her waist, and she instinctively rested hers on his shoulders, their bodies moving slowly together.</p>
  <p>The world seemed to disappear, leaving only the soft glow of the lights and the steady beat of the song in the background. Hector looked down at Ava, his eyes serious for once, like he was about to say something important.</p>
  <p>“Ava,” he started, his voice low. “I meant what I said before. You’re more than just a game to me.”</p>
  <p>Ava’s breath caught in her throat. She had heard him joke and flirt before, but this was different. This was Hector, raw and sincere.</p>
  <p>“I know,” she whispered back. “And I feel the same way.”</p>
  <p>The moment hung in the air for a second, and before either of them could say more, Hector leaned down and kissed her softly on the lips. It wasn’t a fast kiss or a desperate one — it was a promise, a seal to everything they’d shared since that very first sussy moment.</p>
  <p>When they finally pulled away, Ava’s smile reached from ear to ear.</p>
  <p>“I think we’ve got this whole prom thing figured out.”</p>
  <p>Hector laughed, pulling her closer. “I think you’re right.”</p>
  <p>And for that one perfect night, everything was right.</p>
